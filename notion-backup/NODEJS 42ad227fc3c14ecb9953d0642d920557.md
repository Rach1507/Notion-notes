- understand nodejs

The mental model you should have,

is  that node.js accepts JavaScript

and allows to have more features

that we write with it than normal.

Node

is a framework

and also a library of code,

and we have a baseline

to help us to make it easier

to write our own JavaScript,

and we can learn how to use

all of these utilities,

features and functions.

Node contains C++ core , js core

JS core is also acts as a wrapper for the C++ code

for exmple zlib is written in C++ , just thereâ€™s a zlib.js wrapper which does process.binding(zlib.cc) and then brings in all the fdeatures of c+= library and also it has some functions written in js for our helpfulness , func that we use often .

These are just some of the problems

that need to be solved when you're designing a web server,

and some of the things that JavaScript

simply doesn't have ,

and these are the things,

among others,

that Node.js solves for us.
